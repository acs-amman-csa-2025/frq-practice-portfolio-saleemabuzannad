## Problem statement and definition


Big ArrayList  


Use comments in your code to track where you are in the list of tasks below.


Make an ArrayList. Fill it with 19 random numbers from 20 to 90.
Print the ArrayList from the beginning to the end using a for loop
Print the ArrayList from the beginning to the end using a for-each loop
Find and print the number in the center of the arraylist
Find and print the average of the first, last and center numbers?
Find and print the smallest and the largest number in the ArrayList
Switch the largest number with the smallest number. Print the new list.
Create a new random number from 1 to 10 and insert it in the center slot. Print the new list.
Add 10 to every number in the List. Print the new list.
Replace the 3rd element in the array with 5 and print the number that was ousted (try to do this in a single line of code!)
What numbers are in the 50s? Print them all.
What numbers are multiples of 4? Print them all.




## Things I did or review to prepare for this problem


I did varios things,I reviewed CS Awesome to look at code that we did like get,and set feuture I also used coding bat because there was a question that we did that was the same as the one that was asked so I had to check my work I also W3 schools to check out the for each loop, I also used Chat Gpt in some instances for example I did not know what multiple of 4 meant so I asked chat and I also asked chat something and it reminded me the get indexof feature, I also used google to search some stuff up.


## Problems I faced doing this problem
the amount of problems was insane, at first I forgot how to use a for each loop, I struggled a bit with getting the number in the middle of the arraylist because the code indices always got messed up so that took some time, I also ran into the issue of, If I had an edited array and needed to use a new one with the same values I would have to create copies. to get the max and the min I looked at the coding bat question that we did because I forgot how to do it. I also forgot how to use the get index of wich stumped me for a bit and I needed assistance to get the job done with that one even tho I had only forgot how to use it. I also forgot how to do the random numbers because I thought the number to number and the length was all in the same line of code if that makes any sense. but these were all minor issue my biggest issue was that when I got to step 9 where I had to add 10 for every number in the list I had accidentally made a loop that crashed the code and made VS code not print it which led to a really big issue and I thought it was a VS code thing when it was a code thing and it took me hours to figure out the issue. I also ran into the issue of not knowing what multiple mean but that was a quick search.


## Things I learned doing this problem


I learned how to manipulate Array lists in ways I didn't know before. from editing the number to indices to length of array lists it all contributed
