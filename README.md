# Practice Portfolio - AP CS A

We will use this folder assignment to keep track of in-class examples and practice assignments. You will be expected to do a variety of assignments in this folder, submitting as you go, with documentation and comments along the way.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains three folders, where:

- `src`: the folder where we will put our java files. You will create a minimum of one `.java` file per assignment, sometimes more than one. Make sure not to duplicate names!
- `data`: data files will be placed here, as needed. They should be named to match the main `.java` file of the class, for easy organization.
- `docs`: for many assignments, you will be expected to write a documentation of the problem - what you did, problems you faced, what you learned

## How this is assessed

* What you write in comments and your docs will be used to help assess your Process grade for the semester.
* The functionality of your assignments - how accurately they reflect the problem requirements - will be used to help assess your Product grade for the semester
* How good your code is will be used to help assess your Expertise grade for the semester
